## Supported Versions

We currently only support the most recent release. Please do not report issues
for older versions if they do not reproduce in the latest release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report issues with our container image directly on the GitHub tracker

If you find a security related bug in Argo CD Image Updater, we kindly ask you
for responsible disclosure and for giving us appropriate time to react, analyze

We will do our best to react quickly on your inquiry, and to coordinate a fix

react (e.g. out of office conditions), so please bear with us in these cases.

We will publish security advisories using the
[Git Hub Security Advisories](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/security/advisories)
