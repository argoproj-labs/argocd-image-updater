# Getting Started

## Runtime environment

It is recommend to run ArgoCD Image Updater in the same Kubernetes cluster that
ArgoCD is running in, however, this is not a requirement. In fact, it is not
even a requirement to run ArgoCD Image Updater within a Kubernetes cluster or
with access to any Kubernetes cluster at all.

However, some features might not work without accessing Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

ArgoCD Image Updater will need access to the API of your ArgoCD installation.
If you chose to install the ArgoCD Image Updater outside of the cluster where
ArgoCD is running in, the API must be exposed externally (i.e. using Ingress).
If you have network policies in place, make sure that ArgoCD Image Updater will
be allowed to communicate with the ArgoCD API, which is usually the service
`argocd-server` in namespace `argocd` on port 443 and port 80.

### Create a local user within ArgoCD

ArgoCD Image Updater needs credential for accessing the ArgoCD API. Using a
[local user](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/user-management/)
is recommended, but a *project token* will work as well (although, this will
limit updating to the applications of the given project obviously).

Let's use an account named `image-updater` with appropriate API permissions.

Add the following user definition to `argocd-cm`:

```yaml
data:
  # ...
  accounts.image-updater: apiKey
```

Now, you will need to create an access token for this user, which can be either
done using the CLI or the Web UI. The following CLI command will create a named
token for the user and print it to the console:

```shell
argocd account generate-token --account image-updater --id image-updater
```

Copy the token's value somewhere, you will need it later on.

### Granting RBAC permissions in ArgoCD

The technical user `image-updater` we have configured in the previous step now
needs appropriate RBAC permissions within ArgoCD. ArgoCD Image Updater needs
the `update` and `get` permissions on the applications you want to manage.

A most basic version that grants `get` and `update` permissions on all of the
applications managed by ArgoCD might look as follows:

```text
p, role:image-updater, applications, get, */*, allow
p, role:image-updater, applications, update, */*, allow
g, image-updater, role:image-updater
```

You might want to strip that down to apps in a specific project, or to specific
apps, however.

Put the RBAC permissions to ArgoCD's `argocd-rbac-cm` ConfigMap and ArgoCD will
pick them up automatically.

## Installing as Kubernetes workload

Installation is straight-forward. Don't worry, without any configuration, it
will not start messing with your workloads yet.

!!!note
    We also provide a Kustomize base in addition to the plain Kubernetes YAML
    manifests. You can use it as remote base and create overlays with your
    configuration on top of it. The remote base's URL is
    `https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/manifests/base`

### Create a dedicated namespace for ArgoCD Image Updater

```shell
kubectl create ns argocd-image-updater`
```

### Apply the installation manifests

```shell
kubectl apply -n argocd-image-updater -f manifests/install.yaml
```

!!!note "A word on high availabilty"
    It is not advised to run multiple replicas of the same ArgoCD Image Updater
    instance. Just leave the number of replicas at 1, otherwise weird side
    effects could occur.

### Configure ArgoCD endpoint

If you run ArgoCD Image Updater in another cluster than ArgoCD, or if your
ArgoCD installation is not in namespace `argocd` or if you use a default or
otherwise self-signed TLS certificate for ArgoCD API endpoint, you probably
need to divert from the default connection values.

Edit the `argocd-image-updater-config` ConfigMap and add the following keys
(the values are dependent upon your environment)

```yaml
data:
  # The address of ArgoCD API endpoint - defaults to argocd-server.argocd
  argocd.server_addr: <FQDN or IP of your ArgoCD server>
  # Whether to use GRPC-web protocol instead of GRPC over HTTP/2
  argocd.grpc_web: true
  # Whether to ignore invalid TLS cert from ArgoCD API endpoint
  argocd.insecure: false
  # Whether to use plain text connection (http) instead of TLS (https)
  argocd.plaintext: false
```

After changing values in the ConfigMap, ArgoCD Image Updater needs to be
restarted for the changes to take effect, i.e.

```shell
kubectl -n argocd-image-updater rollout restart deployment argocd-image-updater
```

### Configure API access token secret

When installed from the manifests into a Kubernetes cluster, the ArgoCD Image
Updater reads the token required for accessing ArgoCD API from an environment
variable named `ARGOCD_TOKEN`, which is set from a a field named
`argocd.token` in a secret named `argocd-image-updater-secret`.

The value for `argocd.token` should be set to the *base64 encoded* value of the
access token you have generated above. As a short-cut, you can use generate the
secret with `kubectl` and apply it over the existing resource:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic argocd-image-updater-secret \
  --from-literal argocd.token=$YOUR_TOKEN --dry-run -o yaml |
  kubectl -n argocd-image-updater apply -f -
```

You must restart the `argocd-image-updater` pod after such a change, i.e run

```shell
kubectl -n argocd-image-updater rollout restart deployment argocd-image-updater
```

Or alternatively, simply delete the running pod to have it recreated by
Kubernetes automatically.

## Running locally

As long as you have access to the ArgoCD API and your Kubernetes cluster from
your workstation, running ArgoCD Image Updater is simple. Make sure that you
have your API token noted and that your Kubernetes client configuration points
to the correct K8s cluster.

Grab the binary (it does not have any external dependencies) and run:

```bash
export ARGOCD_TOKEN=<yourtoken>
./argocd-image-updater run \
  --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config
  --argocd-server-addr argo-cd.example.com
  --once
```

Note: The `--once` flag disables the health server and the check interval, so
the tool will not regulary check for updates but exit after the first run.

Check `argocd-image-updater --help` for a list of valid command line flags, or
consult the appropriate section of the documentation.

## Running multiple instances

Generally, multiple instances of ArgoCD Image Updater can be run within the same
Kubernetes cluster, however they should not operate on the same set of
applications. This allows for multiple application teams to manage their own set
of applications.

If opting for such an approach, you should make sure that:

* Each instance of ArgoCD Image Updater runs in its own namespace
* Each instance has a dedicated user in ArgoCD, with dedicated RBAC permissions
* RBAC permissions are set-up so that instances cannot interfere with each
  others managed resources
