# Changelog for argocd-image-updater

This is the change log for `argocd-image-updater`. Please read thoroughly
when you upgrade versions, as there might be non-obvious changes that need
handling on your side.

## Unreleased

### Upgrade notes (no really, you MUST read this)

* **Attention**: By default, `argocd-image-updater` now uses the K8s API to retrieve applications, instead of the Argo CD API. Also, it is now recommended to install in the same namespace as Argo CD is running in (`argocd` by default). For existing installations, which are running in a dedicated namespace.

  To retain previous behaviour, set `applications_api: argocd` in `argocd-image-updater-config` ConfigMap before updating. However, it is recommended to move your installation into the `argocd` namespace (or wherever your Argo CD is installed to)

* The permissions for the `argocd-image-updater-sa` ServiceAccount have been adapted to allow read access to resources of type `Secret` and `argoproj.io/Application`

### Bug fixes

* fix: install missing git binary (#148)
* fix: run 'git add' for create files before pushing back (#143)

### New features

* feat: support managing Application CRD using K8S client (#144)
* feat: Allow reuse of Argo CD repo credentials
* feat: Git write-back of parameters (#133)

### Other changes

* refactor: make argocd-image-updater-config volume mapping optional (#145)

## 2020-12-06 - Release v0.8.0

### Upgrade notes (no really, you MUST read this)

* **Attention**: For the `latest` update-strategy, `argocd-image-updater` now fetches v2 manifests by default, instead of the v1 manifests in previous versions. This is to improve compatibility with registry APIs, but may result in a significant higher number of manifest pulls. Due to the recent pull limits imposed by Docker Hub, it is **not recommended** to use `latest` updated strategy with Docker Hub registry anymore if those pull limits are enforced on your account and/or images, especially if you have more than a couple of tags in your image's repository. Fetching meta data for any given tag counts as two pulls from the view point of Docker Hub.

* The default rate limit for API requests is 20 requests per second per registry. If this is too much for your registry, please lower this value in the `registries.conf` by setting `ratelimit` to a lower value.

### Bug fixes

* fix: Correctly apply ignore list when matchfunc is not set (#116)
* fix: Prevent nil pointer dereference in image creds (#126)

### New features

* feat: Get tag creation date also from v2 manifest schemas (#115)
* feat: add argocd-image-updater test command (#117)
* feat: Implement rate limiter and metadata parallelism (#118)
* feat: Support for getting pull creds from external scripts (#121)
* feat: Export Prometheus compatible metrics (#123)
* feat: Support for expiring credentials (#124)

### Other changes

* chore: Update to Golang v1.14.13

## 2020-09-27 - Release v0.7.0

### Upgrade notes (no really, you MUST read this)

**Deprecation notice:** The annotation `argocd-image-updater.argoproj/<image>.tag-match` has been deprecated in favour of `argocd-image-updater.argoproj/<image>.allow-tags` to be consistent with the new `argocd-image-updater.argoproj/<image>.ignore-tags` annotation. The old annotation will still work, but a warning message will be issued in the log. Users are encouraged to rename their annotations asap, as the `tag-match` annotation is subject to removal in a future version of the image updater.

### Bug fixes
* fix: Correctly parse & use pull secret entries without protocol

### New features

* feat: Support for GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
* feat: Allow setting log level from configmap (and environment)
* feat: Allow ignoring set of tags

### Other changes

* refactor: Introduce allow-tags and deprecate tag-match annotation
* chore: Externalize version & build information

## 2020-08-29 - Release v0.5.0

### Upgrade notes (no really, you MUST read this)

If you use the `latest` or `name` update strategy and relied on the semantic
version constraint to limit the list of tags to consider, you will need to
use an additional `tag-match` annotation to limit the tags. The constraint
will only be used for update strategy `semver` from v0.5.0 onwards.

### Bug fixes

* fix: Do not constraint tags to semver if update strategy is latest
* fix: Multiple same images in the same application not possible

### New features

* feat: Allow filtering applications by name patterns

### Other changes

* enhancement: Slightly increase verbosity in default log level
* enhancement: Provide default RBAC rules for serviceaccount
* enhancement: Warm-up cache before starting image cycle

## 2020-08-18 - Release v0.4.0

N/A

### Bug fixes

* fix: Properly load registry configuration
* fix: Use a default path for registries.conf
* fix: Make installation base compatible with Kustomize v2

### New features

* feat: Allow filtering of tags using built-in filter functions
* feat: Allow specifying per-image pull secrets
* feat: Support GitHub Docker registry

### Other changes

* refactor: Lots of refactoring "under the hood"

## 2020-08-11 - Release v0.3.1

## 2020-08-10 - Release v0.3.0

### Upgrade notes (no really, you MUST read this)

* Syntax change for running: `argocd-image-updater run [flags]` instead of `argocd-image-updater [flags]` has now to be used
* **Attention:** Helm annotation names have changed from `<image_alias>.image-{name,tag,spec}` to `<image_alias>.helm.image-{name,tag,spec}`
* Specifying target image name for Kustomize applications now require their own annotation, the image alias is not re-used for this anymore

### Bug fixes

* fix: Possible race while waiting for app updating goroutines

### New features

* feat: Allow setting the sort mode for tags per image via annotation

### Other changes

* refactor: Change run behaviour by providing `run` and `version` commands
* enhancement: Provide a `version` command to print out version information
* enhancement: Allow storing metadata for image tags
* enhancement: Fetch tag metadata along with tags and store creation timestamp

* refactor: Make version constraints parametrizable
* enhancement: Allow sorting of tags by semver, date or name
* refactor: Give annotation names their own namespace-like living room
* enhancement: Kustomize target image name got its own annotation
