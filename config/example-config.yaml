# Example configuration for argocd-image-controller

# Registry configuration. Each registry must have the following properties:
# 
# name (string)
#   A name for the registry. Can be anything basically.
# api_url (string)
#   API endpoint URL
# prefix: (string)
#   The prefix for images from this registry
# ping: (boolean) 
#   Whether to perform a request on /v2 endpoint initially. Some registries
#   do not support this.
# credentials: (string)
#   The credentials to use for the registry. See "specifying credentials" in
#   the documentation for string format.
# 
# Exactly one registry can be specified without a prefix, which is then used
# as the default registry for images. Most likely, this will be Docker Hub.
#
# Each prefix can be specified exactly once. There must not be more than one
# registry with the same prefix configured.
